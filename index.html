				Building on the resounding success of the past edition of ELEKTRA technology summit held in 2018, this year's summit focuses on the advancement in technology and importance of developing skills. As the social impact of technology is being discussed in every nook and corner, there is an urge to bridge the gap between industries an academics. ELEKTRA brings you a collaborative platform for the engineering graduates to analyse and examine the emerging technologies and understand the strategies to balance innovation and methodologies. ELEKTRA 19 is organised by YDYUD in association with IEEE PES SB chapter Munnar. The aim of this initiative is to provide a platform for a genuine exchange of ideas and importantly exchange of knowledge between students and experts.
